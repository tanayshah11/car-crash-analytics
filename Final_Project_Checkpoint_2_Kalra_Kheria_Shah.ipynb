        "The primary goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of traffic crash data across Montgomery County from 2013 to 2017. By examining monthly trends over these years, we aim to provide the UMD community and the general public with insights into the most prevalent types of traffic incidents, as well as the locations and times they most frequently occur. \n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this tutorial, we will explore potential correlations between the types of crashes and their specific locations, the frequency of these incidents at different hours, and how these patterns might vary with the seasons. Our objective is to uncover meaningful trends that can inform safety improvements and awareness initiatives within the community.\n",

Next, the user defines a function that checks if \"Collision Type\" is missing for a row; if it is, the function attempts to impute the missing value using the \"Weather\"-to-\"Collision Type\" mapping. This function is applied to each row of the DataFrame. If \"Collision Type\" is missing and the row's \"Weather\" is found in the mapping, the missing \"Collision Type\" is imputed with the most common type associated with that weather condition. In the end, if still Collision types are missing then they are replaced with the \"Unkown\" tag to remove bias from the table."
