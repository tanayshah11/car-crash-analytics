        "\n",
        "This phase is crucial for preparing the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. Given the extensive nature of the dataset and our specific research objectives, we adopted a selective approach to data preprocessing to ensure efficiency and relevance in our analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Column Selection:\n",
        "Initially, we identified and retained only the most pertinent columns from the complete dataset. This was done to reduce computational load and focus on the data most relevant to our research questions. The selected columns include identifiers like 'Report Number' and 'Local Case Number', details about the crash such as 'Crash Date/Time', 'Collision Type', and environmental conditions like 'Weather' and 'Light'. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Cleaning:\n",
        "The following steps were taken to clean and prepare the data:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Conversion to Suitable Data Types**: We converted the 'Crash Date/Time' column into a datetime format, allowing us to extract and analyze the date and time separately.\n",
        "- **Handling Missing Values**: We filled missing values in categorical columns like 'Hit/Run' and 'Route Type' with the most frequent values or categorized them as 'Unknown'. Numeric fields such as 'Mile Point' were filled using median values to maintain data integrity.\n",
        "- **Imputation Techniques**: For more complex fields like 'Traffic Control' and 'Light', where data might depend on other factors such as 'Road Name' or the time of the crash, we used group-specific modes and conditional imputation. This approach helps maintain logical consistency across related data fields.\n",
        "- **Normalization and Error Correction**: We also addressed duplicates and corrected erroneous entries to ensure the uniqueness and accuracy of our data records.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Enhancing Data Quality:\n",
        "To further enhance the quality of our dataset, we employed several strategies:\n",
        "- **Mode Imputation for Categorical Data**: We imputed missing values in 'Weather' and 'Collision Type' using the most common values conditioned on related attributes, ensuring that our data reflects realistic and probable scenarios.\n",
        "- **Custom Functions for Data Imputation**: For attributes like 'Traffic Control' and 'Light', custom functions were developed to impute values based on the derived rules from the data itself. This method provided a nuanced approach to handling missing data, particularly in cases where simple imputation might not suffice.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Final Dataset Preparation:\n",
        "After these steps, the dataset was transformed into a cleaner, more manageable format, making it ready for the subsequent stages of data analysis and visualization. The focus on careful preprocessing ensures that our findings are based on accurate and representative data, thereby enhancing the reliability of our conclusions."

Next, the user defines a function that checks if \"Collision Type\" is missing for a row; if it is, the function attempts to impute the missing value using the \"Weather\"-to-\"Collision Type\" mapping. This function is applied to each row of the DataFrame. If \"Collision Type\" is missing and the row's \"Weather\" is found in the mapping, the missing \"Collision Type\" is imputed with the most common type associated with that weather condition. In the end, if still Collision types are missing then they are replaced with the \"Unkown\" tag to remove bias from the table."
