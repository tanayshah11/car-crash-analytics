        "The primary goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of traffic crash data across Montgomery County from 2015 to 2023. Our focus is on using machine learning to predict hit-and-run incidents and improve the accuracy of these predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "By examining monthly trends over these years, we aim to provide the UMD community and the general public with insights into the most prevalent types of traffic incidents, including hit-and-run cases, along with the locations and times they most frequently occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this project, we will explore potential correlations between the types of crashes, driver behaviors, environmental factors, and their specific locations. We will also analyze how the frequency of these incidents varies at different hours and during different seasons. Our objective is to uncover meaningful trends that can inform safety improvements and awareness initiatives within the community, with a particular focus on reducing and better predicting hit-and-run incidents.\n",

        "\n",
        "This phase is crucial for preparing the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. Given the extensive nature of the dataset and our specific research objectives, we adopted a selective approach to data preprocessing to ensure efficiency and relevance in our analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Column Selection:\n",
        "Initially, we identified and retained only the most pertinent columns from the complete dataset. This was done to reduce computational load and focus on the data most relevant to our research questions. The selected columns include identifiers like 'Report Number' and 'Local Case Number', details about the crash such as 'Crash Date/Time', 'Collision Type', and environmental conditions like 'Weather' and 'Light'. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Cleaning:\n",
        "The following steps were taken to clean and prepare the data:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Conversion to Suitable Data Types**: We converted the 'Crash Date/Time' column into a datetime format, allowing us to extract and analyze the date and time separately.\n",
        "- **Handling Missing Values**: We filled missing values in categorical columns like 'Hit/Run' and 'Route Type' with the most frequent values or categorized them as 'Unknown'. Numeric fields such as 'Mile Point' were filled using median values to maintain data integrity.\n",
        "- **Imputation Techniques**: For more complex fields like 'Traffic Control' and 'Light', where data might depend on other factors such as 'Road Name' or the time of the crash, we used group-specific modes and conditional imputation. This approach helps maintain logical consistency across related data fields.\n",
        "- **Normalization and Error Correction**: We also addressed duplicates and corrected erroneous entries to ensure the uniqueness and accuracy of our data records.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Enhancing Data Quality:\n",
        "To further enhance the quality of our dataset, we employed several strategies:\n",
        "- **Mode Imputation for Categorical Data**: We imputed missing values in 'Weather' and 'Collision Type' using the most common values conditioned on related attributes, ensuring that our data reflects realistic and probable scenarios.\n",
        "- **Custom Functions for Data Imputation**: For attributes like 'Traffic Control' and 'Light', custom functions were developed to impute values based on the derived rules from the data itself. This method provided a nuanced approach to handling missing data, particularly in cases where simple imputation might not suffice.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Final Dataset Preparation:\n",
        "After these steps, the dataset was transformed into a cleaner, more manageable format, making it ready for the subsequent stages of data analysis and visualization. The focus on careful preprocessing ensures that our findings are based on accurate and representative data, thereby enhancing the reliability of our conclusions."

This function is applied to each row of the DataFrame. If \"Collision Type\" is missing and the row's \"Weather\" is found in the mapping, the missing \"Collision Type\" is imputed with the most common type associated with that weather condition.

        "\n",
        "This stage, often referred to as the Exploratory Analysis and Visualization phase of the data lifecycle, is where we dive deep into the dataset to uncover trends, test hypotheses, and draw insights. By utilizing statistical analysis and visual tools, we aim to validate our hypotheses and inform decision-making processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hypothesis Testing:\n",
        "We have formulated several hypotheses to guide our analysis and ensure it addresses specific research questions about traffic incidents in Montgomery County. Here's how we are approaching each hypothesis:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Light Conditions and Hit/Run Incidents:**\n",
        "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no significant difference in the proportion of hit/run incidents between daylight and dark conditions.\n",
        "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The proportion of hit/run incidents differs significantly between daylight and dark conditions.\n",
        "   - **Analysis Approach**: We will use a Z-test for two proportions, as it is suitable for large sample sizes. This test will help us compare the rates of hit/run incidents under different lighting conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Weather Conditions and Crash Incidents:**\n",
        "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no significant difference in the number of crash incidents during clear versus adverse weather conditions.\n",
        "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a significant difference in the number of crash incidents between clear and adverse weather conditions.\n",
        "   - **Analysis Approach**: Depending on data categorization and distribution, we might use a chi-square test for categorical data or a t-test for continuous data to compare crash incident rates across different weather conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Driver Substance Abuse vs Hit/Run:**\n",
        "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no significant difference in the proportion of hit/run incidents between drivers with and without substance abuse.\n",
        "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The proportion of hit/run incidents is significantly higher among drivers who have abused substances.\n",
        "   - **Analysis Approach**: A chi-square test is used to determine if there's a significant association between substance abuse and hit-and-run incidents, focusing on the difference in proportions of such incidents between drivers who have and have not abused substances.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Visualization:\n",
        "In addition to hypothesis testing, we are employing various data visualization techniques to illustrate and explore potential trends within the dataset. This involves:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Plotting Key Trends**: We use graphs such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to visually represent the data, making it easier to identify patterns or anomalies.\n",
        "- **Frequency Analysis**: By analyzing the frequency of specific types of incidents, such as hit/run or specific collision types, we can identify which scenarios occur most frequently and may require additional focus or preventive measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Statistical Analysis:\n",
        "We perform detailed statistical analyses to provide a robust foundation for our findings. This includes:\n",
        "- **Descriptive Statistics**: To summarize the central tendencies and dispersion in our data.\n",
        "- **Inferential Statistics**: To draw conclusions about the larger population from our sample data, specifically testing our hypotheses under different conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this phase, we aim to have a clear understanding of the factors that influence traffic incidents in Montgomery County, guided by data-driven insights and rigorous statistical validation. This approach not only helps in affirming or refuting our initial hypotheses but also aids in identifying areas where traffic safety can be improved."

The objective is to design and develop predictive models that can efficiently analyze patterns and predict outcomes based on historical data. For this project, we are particularly focused on evaluating the impact of driver substance abuse on hit-and-run incidents.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Preparation for ML:\n",
        "To prepare our dataset for machine learning analysis, we convert the 'Hit/Run' column into a binary format where 'Yes' is coded as 1 and 'No' as 0. This allows us to treat the problem as a binary classification task. We then define our target variable `y` as the 'Hit/Run' column and the feature matrix `X` as all other columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Training and Evaluation:\n",
        "We use a `Neural Network` for our predictive model due to its robustness and effectiveness in handling both numerical and categorical data. The steps include:\n",
        "- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with 20% of the data reserved for testing. This split ensures that we have a separate dataset to evaluate our model's performance objectively.\n",
        "- **Model Training**: We train the RNeural Network model on the training data. This process involves fixing the weights in a backtracking form for particular models and then aggregating their predictions to improve accuracy and control overfitting.\n",
        "- **Model Prediction**: After training, the model predicts the 'Hit/Run' outcome on the testing set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performance Metrics:\n",
        "To evaluate the model's performance, we use several metrics:\n",
        "- **Accuracy**: This gives us the proportion of total predictions that were correct.\n",
        "- **Classification Report**: This includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. These metrics provide deeper insights into the model's performance, especially useful in imbalanced datasets where accuracy alone might be misleading.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights and Adjustments:\n",
        "Based on the initial outcomes, we may tweak the model parameters, try different algorithms, or revisit the feature selection process to optimize performance. Continuous refinement is key to developing a robust model that accurately predicts outcomes and provides valuable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "This comprehensive approach ensures that our machine learning model is not only predictive but also interpretable, providing clear insights into how substance abuse may influence hit-and-run behaviors."

        "### Interpretation:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Accuracy of 82%** suggests that the model is generally effective in predicting whether an incident will be a hit-and-run. However, this high accuracy might be somewhat misleading due to the imbalanced nature of our dataset (where non-hit-and-run incidents significantly outnumber hit-and-run cases).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For the 'Hit/Run' class (Class 0):\n",
        "- **Precision for 'Not Hit/Run' (Class 0)** is quite high at 0.82, indicating that when the model predicts an incident is not a hit-and-run, it is correct 82% of the time.\n",
        "- **F1-Score for 'Not Hit/Run'** is 0.90, reflecting a good balance between precision and recall for this class.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the 'Hit/Run' class (Class 1), which is of particular interest:\n",
        "- **Precision** is low at 0.70, suggesting that only 70% of the incidents the model labels as hit-and-run are actually so. This indicates a moderate false positive rate.\n",
        "- **F1-Score** of 0.08 is very low, indicating poor performance of the model on the hit-and-run cases due to low precision and recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "What can be done better:\n",
        "1. **Imbalanced Classes**: The imbalance in the dataset likely contributes significantly to the skewed performance favoring the non-hit-and-run class. Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), adjusting class weights, or more targeted data collection could help balance the dataset and potentially improve model performance on the minority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Model Experimentation**: Exploring different algorithms that might be more sensitive to imbalanced data could be beneficial. Algorithms like Gradient Boosting or even deep learning models might capture complex patterns better, though they require careful tuning to avoid overfitting."

        "### Implications:\n",
        "The confusion matrix reveals that while the model is quite good at identifying non-hit-and-run incidents, it performs poorly in detecting actual hit-and-run incidents, which are likely more critical to predict accurately. This could be due to a variety of factors including class imbalance, insufficiently discriminative features, or suboptimal model parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis indicates that the features used in the model, maybe higly class imbalanced (precisely because the data is infiltrated with tons of NANS in variety of features) and improvements are necessary, particularly in terms of enhancing the model’s ability to detect hit-and-run incidents, which is crucial for practical applications."

        "Throughout our analysis of traffic crash data in Montgomery County from 2015 to 2023, we focused on using machine learning models to predict and analyze hit-and-run incidents. The data was subjected to various preprocessing techniques to ensure accuracy, and multiple models, including neural networks, were tested to find the most effective predictors of these incidents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our latest model, a neural network, demonstrated an overall accuracy of approximately 82%. Despite this high accuracy, a detailed examination of the precision and recall metrics, particularly for hit-and-run predictions, reveals that the model still struggles significantly with identifying true hit-and-run incidents. While the precision for non-hit-and-run predictions is relatively high at 0.82, the precision for hit-and-run incidents is much lower at 0.64, and the recall for these incidents is critically low at 0.05, leading to an F1-score of only 0.09.\n",

        "This pattern indicates that although the neural network performs well in identifying non-hit-and-run cases (with a recall of 0.99 and an F1-score of 0.90), it is less effective at detecting hit-and-run incidents. The ROC curve and Precision-Recall curves support this, suggesting modest effectiveness in distinguishing between the two classes (ROC AUC of approximately 0.59).\n",
        "\n",
        "The confusion matrix analysis further highlights a significant issue with false negatives, showing that many hit-and-run incidents are not being correctly identified. This critical shortfall underscores the need for considerable improvements in the model's sensitivity to hit-and-run incidents, which is essential for practical applications where accurate detection of such incidents could greatly influence public safety and legal outcomes.\n",

        "\n",
        "The analysis conducted provides valuable insights into the patterns of traffic incidents in Montgomery County, with a specific emphasis on hit-and-run cases. Although the model achieved a reasonable degree of accuracy, the low precision and recall for predicting hit-and-run incidents suggest that it is not yet reliable enough for practical use in safety improvement strategies without further refinement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on our findings, we recommend the following:\n",
        "1. **Enhanced Monitoring and Safety Measures:** Given the frequent occurrence of hit-and-run incidents at specific times and locations, increased monitoring and targeted safety campaigns during these peak periods could be beneficial.\n",
        "2. **Improvement of Predictive Models:** To improve the predictive power of our models, additional features should be considered, and more sophisticated machine learning techniques could be employed. Techniques such as feature engineering, balancing the dataset, or exploring more complex algorithms like Gradient Boosting or deep learning may yield better results.\n",
        "3. **Focused Public Awareness Campaigns:** Public education and awareness campaigns tailored to the times and locations most susceptible to hit-and-run incidents can help reduce their occurrence.\n",
        "4. **Continued Research:** Further analysis should also consider expanding the dataset to include more years and possibly additional variables that could influence the rate of hit-and-run incidents. An expanded analysis could provide deeper insights into underlying causes and help refine preventive measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project has laid a foundational understanding of traffic incident patterns in Montgomery County, offering a starting point for further research and intervention strategies aimed at reducing traffic-related incidents, particularly hit-and-runs."
