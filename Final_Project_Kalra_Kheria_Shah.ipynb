        "### **Project Brief** \n",
        "\n",
        "The primary goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of traffic crash data across Montgomery County from 2015 to 2023. Our focus is on using machine learning to predict hit-and-run incidents and improve the accuracy of these predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "By examining monthly trends over these years, we aim to provide the UMD community and the general public with insights into the most prevalent types of traffic incidents, including hit-and-run cases, along with the locations and times they most frequently occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this project, we will explore potential correlations between the types of crashes, driver behaviors, environmental factors, and their specific locations. We will also analyze how the frequency of these incidents varies at different hours and during different seasons. Our objective is to uncover meaningful trends that can inform safety improvements and awareness initiatives within the community, with a particular focus on reducing and better predicting hit-and-run incidents.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach will not only help in understanding the dynamics of traffic incidents but also in developing strategies to enhance predictive models for better safety outcomes.\n",

        "\n",
        "This phase is crucial for preparing the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. Given the extensive nature of the dataset and our specific research objectives, we adopted a selective approach to data preprocessing to ensure efficiency and relevance in our analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Column Selection:\n",
        "Initially, we identified and retained only the most pertinent columns from the complete dataset. This was done to reduce computational load and focus on the data most relevant to our research questions. The selected columns include identifiers like 'Report Number' and 'Local Case Number', details about the crash such as 'Crash Date/Time', 'Collision Type', and environmental conditions like 'Weather' and 'Light'. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Cleaning:\n",
        "The following steps were taken to clean and prepare the data:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Conversion to Suitable Data Types**: We converted the 'Crash Date/Time' column into a datetime format, allowing us to extract and analyze the date and time separately.\n",
        "- **Handling Missing Values**: We filled missing values in categorical columns like 'Hit/Run' and 'Route Type' with the most frequent values or categorized them as 'Unknown'. Numeric fields such as 'Mile Point' were filled using median values to maintain data integrity.\n",
        "- **Imputation Techniques**: For more complex fields like 'Traffic Control' and 'Light', where data might depend on other factors such as 'Road Name' or the time of the crash, we used group-specific modes and conditional imputation. This approach helps maintain logical consistency across related data fields.\n",
        "- **Normalization and Error Correction**: We also addressed duplicates and corrected erroneous entries to ensure the uniqueness and accuracy of our data records.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Enhancing Data Quality:\n",
        "To further enhance the quality of our dataset, we employed several strategies:\n",
        "- **Mode Imputation for Categorical Data**: We imputed missing values in 'Weather' and 'Collision Type' using the most common values conditioned on related attributes, ensuring that our data reflects realistic and probable scenarios.\n",
        "- **Custom Functions for Data Imputation**: For attributes like 'Traffic Control' and 'Light', custom functions were developed to impute values based on the derived rules from the data itself. This method provided a nuanced approach to handling missing data, particularly in cases where simple imputation might not suffice.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Final Dataset Preparation:\n",
        "After these steps, the dataset was transformed into a cleaner, more manageable format, making it ready for the subsequent stages of data analysis and visualization. The focus on careful preprocessing ensures that our findings are based on accurate and representative data, thereby enhancing the reliability of our conclusions."

This function is applied to each row of the DataFrame. If \"Collision Type\" is missing and the row's \"Weather\" is found in the mapping, the missing \"Collision Type\" is imputed with the most common type associated with that weather condition.

        "\n",
        "This stage, often referred to as the Exploratory Analysis and Visualization phase of the data lifecycle, is where we dive deep into the dataset to uncover trends, test hypotheses, and draw insights. By utilizing statistical analysis and visual tools, we aim to validate our hypotheses and inform decision-making processes.\n",

        "### Hypothesis Testing:\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Light Conditions and Hit/Run Incidents:**\n",
        "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no significant difference in the proportion of hit/run incidents between daylight and dark conditions.\n",
        "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The proportion of hit/run incidents differs significantly between daylight and dark conditions.\n",
        "   - **Analysis Approach**: We will use a Z-test for two proportions, as it is suitable for large sample sizes. This test will help us compare the rates of hit/run incidents under different lighting conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Weather Conditions and Crash Incidents:**\n",
        "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no significant difference in the number of crash incidents during clear versus adverse weather conditions.\n",
        "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a significant difference in the number of crash incidents between clear and adverse weather conditions.\n",
        "   - **Analysis Approach**: Depending on data categorization and distribution, we might use a chi-square test for categorical data or a t-test for continuous data to compare crash incident rates across different weather conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Driver Substance Abuse vs Hit/Run:**\n",
        "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no significant difference in the proportion of hit/run incidents between drivers with and without substance abuse.\n",
        "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The proportion of hit/run incidents is significantly higher among drivers who have abused substances.\n",
        "   - **Analysis Approach**: A chi-square test is used to determine if there's a significant association between substance abuse and hit-and-run incidents, focusing on the difference in proportions of such incidents between drivers who have and have not abused substances.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Visualization:\n",
        "In addition to hypothesis testing, we are employing various data visualization techniques to illustrate and explore potential trends within the dataset. This involves:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Plotting Key Trends**: We use graphs such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to visually represent the data, making it easier to identify patterns or anomalies.\n",
        "- **Frequency Analysis**: By analyzing the frequency of specific types of incidents, such as hit/run or specific collision types, we can identify which scenarios occur most frequently and may require additional focus or preventive measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Statistical Analysis:\n",
        "We perform detailed statistical analyses to provide a robust foundation for our findings. This includes:\n",
        "- **Descriptive Statistics**: To summarize the central tendencies and dispersion in our data.\n",
        "- **Inferential Statistics**: To draw conclusions about the larger population from our sample data, specifically testing our hypotheses under different conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this phase, we aim to have a clear understanding of the factors that influence traffic incidents in Montgomery County, guided by data-driven insights and rigorous statistical validation. This approach not only helps in affirming or refuting our initial hypotheses but also aids in identifying areas where traffic safety can be improved."

The objective is to design and develop predictive models that can efficiently analyze patterns and predict outcomes based on historical data. For this project, we are particularly focused on evaluating the impact of driver substance abuse on hit-and-run incidents.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Preparation for ML:\n",
        "To prepare our dataset for machine learning analysis, we convert the 'Hit/Run' column into a binary format where 'Yes' is coded as 1 and 'No' as 0. This allows us to treat the problem as a binary classification task. We then define our target variable `y` as the 'Hit/Run' column and the feature matrix `X` as all other columns.\n",

        "We use a `RandomForestClassifier` for our predictive model due to its robustness and effectiveness in handling both numerical and categorical data. The steps include:\n",
        "- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with 20% of the data reserved for testing. This split ensures that we have a separate dataset to evaluate our model's performance objectively.\n",
        "- **Model Training**: We train the RandomForest model on the training data. This process involves building multiple decision trees and aggregating their predictions to improve accuracy and control overfitting.\n",
        "- **Model Prediction**: After training, the model predicts the 'Hit/Run' outcome on the testing set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performance Metrics:\n",
        "To evaluate the model's performance, we use several metrics:\n",
        "- **Accuracy**: This gives us the proportion of total predictions that were correct.\n",
        "- **Classification Report**: This includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. These metrics provide deeper insights into the model's performance, especially useful in imbalanced datasets where accuracy alone might be misleading.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights and Adjustments:\n",
        "Based on the initial outcomes, we may tweak the model parameters, try different algorithms, or revisit the feature selection process to optimize performance. Continuous refinement is key to developing a robust model that accurately predicts outcomes and provides valuable insights.\n",

        "1. **Imbalanced Classes**: The imbalance in the dataset likely contributes significantly to the skewed performance favoring the non-hit-and-run class. Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), adjusting class weights, or more targeted data collection could help balance the dataset and potentially improve model performance on the minority class.\n",

Including more relevant features, or transforming existing features might uncover more significant patterns in the data relevant to hit-and-run incidents.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model Experimentation**: Exploring different algorithms that might be more sensitive to imbalanced data could be beneficial. Algorithms like Gradient Boosting or even deep learning models might capture complex patterns better, though they require careful tuning to avoid overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjusting the decision threshold for classifying hit-and-run incidents could help manage the trade-off between precision and recall, especially for the hit-and-run class.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Performance Metrics**: Given the class imbalance, metrics like ROC-AUC might provide a more comprehensive view of model performance across different decision thresholds.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while the model performs well in identifying non-hit-and-run incidents, it struggles significantly with hit-and-run cases, which are critical to predict accurately for practical applications. Addressing the imbalance in the dataset and refining the model could lead to more reliable predictions."

        "### Analysis:\n",
        "- **Accuracy:** The model has an accuracy of 80%, which seems reasonably high. However, this number is somewhat deceptive given the significant imbalance between the classes in your dataset (many more non-hit-and-run incidents than hit-and-run).\n",
        "- **Precision:** At approximately 33.5%, the precision is relatively low, indicating that when the model predicts an incident as a hit-and-run, it is correct only about one-third of the time.\n",
        "- **Recall:** The recall is particularly low at about 10.2%, showing that the model identifies only about 10% of all actual hit-and-run incidents. This suggests that many hit-and-run incidents are being missed by the model (high number of false negatives).\n",
        "- **F1 Score:** The F1 score, which balances precision and recall, is quite low (0.154), indicating poor performance of the model, especially in terms of identifying the positive class (hit-and-run incidents).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implications:\n",
        "The confusion matrix reveals that while the model is quite good at identifying non-hit-and-run incidents, it performs poorly in detecting actual hit-and-run incidents, which are likely more critical to predict accurately. This could be due to a variety of factors including class imbalance, insufficiently discriminative features, or suboptimal model parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recommendations:\n",
        "1. **Addressing Imbalance:** Techniques like SMOTE, adjusting class weights during training, or targeted data collection could help improve model performance, especially recall.\n",
        "2. **Feature Engineering:** Enhancing the set of features used by the model could provide better differentiation between classes.\n",
        "3. **Model Adjustment:** Trying different models or tuning existing model parameters might yield improvements. Considering models that are robust to imbalanced data could also be beneficial.\n",
        "4. **Threshold Tuning:** Adjusting the decision threshold could help improve precision and recall based on what is more critical for your needs (either reducing false positives or reducing false negatives).\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis indicates that improvements are necessary, particularly in terms of enhancing the model’s ability to detect hit-and-run incidents, which is crucial for practical applications."

        "### ROC Curve\n",
        "The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is another useful tool, particularly for binary classification problems. It plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings, giving you insight into the trade-offs between sensitivity (recall) and specificity."

        "### Overview of the Curve\n",
        "The ROC curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. It plots the True Positive Rate (TPR, or recall) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Observations:\n",
        "- **Curve Shape and Position**: The ROC curve of your model lies above the diagonal line (which represents a random classifier) but is not close to the top-left corner of the plot. The closer the curve comes to the top-left corner, the higher the overall accuracy of the test.\n",
        "- **Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.59**: This value indicates that your model has a 59% chance of distinguishing between the positive class and negative class. An AUC of 0.5 represents a model with no discriminative ability (equivalent to random guessing), while an AUC of 1.0 represents a perfect model. An AUC of 0.59 suggests that the model has limited discriminative ability, just slightly better than random guessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implications:\n",
        "- **Moderate Discrimination**: The ROC AUC score implies that your model has a moderate ability to distinguish between the classes. However, it's relatively close to non-discriminatory (AUC = 0.5), indicating that there might be significant room for improvement.\n",
        "- **Sensitivity vs. Specificity Balance**: The ROC curve suggests that any increase in sensitivity (ability to detect true positives) will likely be accompanied by a decrease in specificity (increase in false positives). This might be an issue if the cost of a false positive is high in your application context.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recommendations:\n",
        "1. **Feature Engineering**: Revisiting and possibly enhancing your feature set could provide the model with more informative cues to improve classification accuracy.\n",
        "2. **Model Tuning**: Adjusting model parameters or trying different machine learning algorithms might help. Sometimes, more complex models like Gradient Boosting or deep learning models might capture complex patterns better.\n",
        "3. **Data Quality and Quantity**: Ensuring the quality of your data and possibly increasing the dataset size could help improve model performance. More data, especially more examples of the minority class, could provide a more balanced dataset for training.\n",
        "4. **Advanced Techniques**: Consider using techniques such as ensemble methods, which combine the predictions of multiple models to improve accuracy.\n",
        "5. **Cost-sensitive Learning**: If false positives and false negatives have different costs, consider using cost-sensitive learning which incorporates these costs in the model training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "The ROC curve analysis highlights that while your model does perform better than random guessing, its ability to discriminate between classes effectively is still marginal. Employing a combination of improved modeling techniques, better feature engineering, and perhaps more balanced data could lead to a more effective predictive model."

        "### Overview of the Curve\n",
        "The Precision-Recall curve shows how the precision (the accuracy of the positive predictions) varies with the recall (the ability of the model to find all the relevant cases) for different threshold settings. The area under the curve (AUC) for your model is 0.26, which provides a quantitative measure of the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Observations:\n",
        "1. **Initial High Precision**: The curve starts at a high precision near 1.0 but with almost zero recall. This indicates that if you set a very high threshold for classifying a prediction as positive (hit-and-run), the few predictions made are very likely to be correct, but the model misses almost all actual positive cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sharp Drop in Precision**: As recall increases (i.e., as the model starts classifying more samples as hit-and-run), the precision drops sharply. This rapid fall in precision at low levels of recall suggests that the model starts to make more false positive errors very quickly as it attempts to capture more true positives.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Low Overall Precision-Recall AUC**: The area under the curve (AUC) of 0.26 is relatively low, which generally indicates poor overall performance of the model in terms of both precision and recall. A high-performing model would ideally have a curve that stays high on the Y-axis (precision) as recall increases, reflecting a larger AUC closer to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implications:\n",
        "- **Model's Limitations**: The curve suggests that the model struggles to balance precision and recall — it either misses a significant number of positive cases or makes too many false positive errors. This might be due to insufficient or non-informative features, class imbalance, or other model-specific limitations.\n",
        "- **Potential Overfitting**: The initial high precision at very low recall levels could also indicate overfitting to a small number of cases where the model is overly confident, but which do not generalize well across the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recommendations:\n",
        "1. **Improving Feature Selection**: Investigate and possibly enhance the feature set. Adding more relevant features or creating new feature interactions might help the model make more accurate classifications.\n",
        "2. **Rebalancing Dataset**: Given the likely class imbalance, consider techniques such as SMOTE for oversampling the minority class or adjusting class weights in the model training process.\n",
        "3. **Experiment with Different Models**: Some models might be more effective at handling imbalanced data. Trying out models like Gradient Boosting or even deep learning architectures might yield better results.\n",
        "4. **Adjust Decision Thresholds**: Experiment with different decision thresholds to find a better balance between precision and recall. This could involve setting a lower threshold if increasing recall is a priority, albeit at the cost of reducing precision.\n",
        "5. **Cross-validation**: Implement robust cross-validation techniques to ensure the model’s performance is consistent across different subsets of your data and to prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "The Precision-Recall curve serves as a crucial diagnostic tool, especially in scenarios with imbalanced classes. The analysis indicates that while the model can predict some positives very accurately (high initial precision), its ability to generalize well across the broader dataset needs improvement.\n"

        "\n",
        "Throughout our analysis of traffic crash data in Montgomery County from 2015 to 2023, we focused on using machine learning models to predict and analyze hit-and-run incidents. The data was subjected to various preprocessing techniques to ensure accuracy, and multiple models were tested to find the most effective predictors of these incidents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our machine learning model, specifically the RandomForestClassifier, demonstrated an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. However, a closer look at the precision and recall metrics, especially for hit-and-run predictions, revealed that the model struggled significantly with identifying true hit-and-run incidents (precision of 33.5% and recall of 10.2%). The ROC curve and Precision-Recall curves further suggested that while the model performs better than random chance (ROC AUC of 0.59), its ability to distinguish between classes effectively is modest.\n",
        "\n",
        "Confusion matrix analysis showed a large number of false negatives, indicating that many hit-and-run incidents were not being correctly identified. This highlights a critical area for improvement in the model's sensitivity to hit-and-run incidents.\n",

        "## **Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis conducted provides valuable insights into the patterns of traffic incidents in Montgomery County, with a specific emphasis on hit-and-run cases. Although the model achieved a reasonable degree of accuracy, the low precision and recall for predicting hit-and-run incidents suggest that it is not yet reliable enough for practical use in safety improvement strategies without further refinement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on our findings, we recommend the following:\n",
        "1. **Enhanced Monitoring and Safety Measures:** Given the frequent occurrence of hit-and-run incidents at specific times and locations, increased monitoring and targeted safety campaigns during these peak periods could be beneficial.\n",
        "2. **Improvement of Predictive Models:** To improve the predictive power of our models, additional features should be considered, and more sophisticated machine learning techniques could be employed. Techniques such as feature engineering, balancing the dataset, or exploring more complex algorithms like Gradient Boosting or deep learning may yield better results.\n",
        "3. **Focused Public Awareness Campaigns:** Public education and awareness campaigns tailored to the times and locations most susceptible to hit-and-run incidents can help reduce their occurrence.\n",
        "4. **Continued Research:** Further analysis should also consider expanding the dataset to include more years and possibly additional variables that could influence the rate of hit-and-run incidents. An expanded analysis could provide deeper insights into underlying causes and help refine preventive measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project has laid a foundational understanding of traffic incident patterns in Montgomery County, offering a starting point for further research and intervention strategies aimed at reducing traffic-related incidents, particularly hit-and-runs."
